This is the repository for the article **"Optimizing EEGNet for Code-Modulated Visual Evoked Potential Classification."**

The repository will be updated soon with the complete functional code.

In the meantime, we have provided a sample snippet in **`ablation_snippet.py`**.

We aim to prepare the codes for release by **October 31, 2025**.
